# Quick Start

kube-trigger can run as standalone or in-cluster. Let's use a real use-case as an exmaple (
see [#4418](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/4418)). TL;DR, the user want the Application to be automatically
updated whenever the ConfigMaps that are referenced by `ref-objects` are updated.

## Prerequisites

- Install [KubeVela](https://kubevela.net/docs/install) in your cluster
- Enable the `kube-trigger` addon
```shell
vela addon enable kube-trigger
```

## What we want to achieve?

- use a `resource-watcher` Source to listen to update events of ConfigMaps
- use a `cue-validator` Filter to only keep the ConfigMaps that we are interested in
- trigger an `bump-application-revision` Action to update Application.

As a result:

- Once any of the two ConfigMaps are updated, both Applications will be updated as well.

## Try out

1. **Apply sample resources**

Apply `sample.yaml` to create 2 Applications and 2 ConfigMaps in the default namespace. The changes in 2 ConfigMaps will
trigger 2 Application updates.

```shell
kubectl apply -f examples/sample.yaml
```

2. **Run kube-trigger**

Choose your preferred way: standalone (recommended for quick testing) or in-cluster

Standalone:

```shell
# Download kube-trigger binaries from releases first
./kube-trigger --config sampleconf-bump-app.yaml
```

In-Cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/crd/
kubectl apply -f config/definition/
kubectl apply -f config/manager/
```

3. **Watch ApplicationRevision changes** so that you can see what it does.

```shell
kubectl get apprev --watch
```

4. **Edit any of the two ConfigMaps** (do this in another terminal)

```shell
kubectl edit cm this-will-trigger-update-1
```

Immediately, you should see the two new ApplicationRevision created. Specifically, Applications all have updated with
annotation: `app.oam.dev/publishVersion: '2/3/4...'`

## Delete resources

Just replace all `kubectl apply` with `kubectl delete`, and run them in the reverse order.
